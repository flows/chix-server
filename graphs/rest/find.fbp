# stream, then a sink for the documents and then just
# send the output like normal. Besides from being faster
# it would even be easier to do.

# >= in never takes place probably.
# or maybe even when one is in error it already hangs.
# because the group is not complete.
# I could have any chi going to error, to be automatically removed.
# Anyway if _all_ fail it still wouldn't reach the end.
# but at least removing errors automatically from the the group would
# be nice, with a group complete adjustment or something.
